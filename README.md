# Final-Public-Dotnet-Webservice

# This repo contains the code for a dotnet 6 app which displays sunscreen details
# To solve some errors that were encountered during the deployment, a new folder was created inside the repo and inside that directory the app was build, advantage by doing so is that the .sln solution file will be pushed to the repo properly and by this workflow will work properly
